# This configuration file is typically set up once as your global default.
# For each individual project, you only need to add overrides or additional
# settings as necessary.
#
# By default, this file is installed to either ~/.config/olint/olint.cfg
# or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/olint/olint.cfg, depending on your environment.
# Running ./deploy will not overwrite an existing configuration file.
# If a config file already exists, you can either delete it or manually
# incorporate the new settings into your existing configuration.
#
# Configuration Notes:
# - Using '+=' appends new items to the existing list.
# - Using '=' replaces the entire list. This can be useful for project-specific
#   configurations where the global config includes many items that are
#   irrelevant but need consideration for a specific project.
#
# By default, olint ignores some common file patterns. You can override
# these defaults by using = in your global or project-specific config file.
# Running 'olint -c' will display the current settings. If the defaults
# don't meet your needs, you can override them here.

#  Use 'skip_linters' to disable specific linters from your workflow or
# for a specific project.
#  Uncomment the linters you want to exclude from being run.
